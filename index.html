   <h1><center> c l o u d s &nbsp; o f &nbsp; a n g u i s h </center></h1>

The lone, solitary scream of agony <br>
Of the clouds ripped through the dark silence. <br>
The bass of the noise- an unorganized symphony <br>
For all that it craves and for which lost it’s sense.<br><br>

The misery of the clouds as water, its lifeline<br>
Threatens to leave was one no language can express<br>
As the sky glooms over, not even the sun’s mighty shine<br>
Could brighten up the clouds that were depressed<br><br>

The clouds’ screams that we call thunder,<br>
Begs the water to not leave it alone, to stay true to their promise <br>
But the damage had been done; the cloud had committed the blunder<br>
Gone were their beautiful days of happiness and bliss.<br<br>

The clouds can’t express their emotions in words<br>
So they pour out their sadness and anger in the form of thunder<br>
The water takes no heed to the screams, the curses<br>
‘How could you be so cruel’ the by passers wonder.<br><br>

Oceans to fill and fields to water, the rain holds its head up proud<br>
It has to go down in the form of pellets of rain<br>
But in this process inhibits the very existence of clouds<br>
And no matter what the cloud had done, it didn’t deserve the pain.<br><br>

‘I have duties to fulfill and you have wronged me’ the water smiles<br>
‘One more chance’ the clouds beg the water that’s slowly slipping away<br>
The rain maintained the deadly silence for a while<br>
‘For in the end, who are you without me?’ with those parting words, the water slipped away.<br><br>

            I want to hold you close like a paper blade, <br> 
            and I know it'll hurt, but pain has always been a close friend, <br>
            I guess that's okay :))  <br>

            A word of promise,<br>
    To not breathe a word about it.<br>
    Not even a soul,<br>
    No matter how persistent the growl. <br>
    Down the drain,<br>
    Goes everything in vain.<br>
    Because you failed,<br>
    You lost your fairy tale.<br>

    In the stars that cast their shine on life, <br>
    in the eyes that are enthralled by the stars, <br>
    In eyes that have witnessed the helpless’ strife, <br>
    There is a spell bounding beauty in all. <br> <br>
    
    In the eyes that stare at the crashing ocean waves, <br>
    In the gentle waves that softly reflect the sky’s blue, <br>
    In the harsh waves that turn solid rocks to caves, <br>
    There is a spell bounding beauty in all. <br> <br>
    
    In the waves of emotions that take over, <br>
    In the people who are strong enough to bear it all, <br>
    In the people who are weak and scared of new endeavours, <br>
    There is a spell bounding beauty in all. <br> <br>
    
    In those who in the darkest moments, notice the faint sliver of light, <br>
    In the people who have seen the worst life gives us, <br>
    In those who are used to the dark that now the world seems too bright, <br>
    There is a spell bounding beauty in all. <br> <br>

        Love is such a strange thing <br>
        Like the leech that takes and never gives<br>
        And like the rain that takes and gives<br>
        And like the sun that gives and never takes.<br><br>
        
        Love is such a strange thing<br>
        Like a wildfire that takes<br>
        Everything in its path into its arms of flame<br>
        And sings as it singes with an eternal air<br><br>
